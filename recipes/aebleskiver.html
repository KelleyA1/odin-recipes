  <strong><p>Ingredients</p></strong>
  <ul>
<li>3 large eggs, separated, room temperature</li>
<li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
<li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
<li>2 medium peaches, peeled and chopped</li>
<li>'Confectioners' sugar</li>

  </ul>

  <strong><p>Directions</p></strong>
<ol>
  <li>In a large bowl, whisk egg yolks and buttermilk until blended. In another bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, salt and cinnamon. Stir into egg mixture just until moistened. In a small bowl, beat egg whites on high speed until stiff but not dry. With a rubber spatula, gently stir a quarter of the egg whites into batter. Fold in remaining egg whites.
    Place a greased aebleskiver pan over medium heat. In batches, pour 1 tablespoon batter into each cup. Top with a peach piece and another 1 tablespoon batter. Cook until bubbles on top begin to pop and bottoms are golden brown. Turn; cook until second side is golden brown. Serve warm with confectioners' sugar. Freeze option: Freeze cooled pancakes between layers of waxed paper in a freezer container. To use, place pancakes on an ungreased baking sheet, cover with foil and reheat in a preheated 375Â° oven until heated through, 5-10 minutes. Or, place on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high until heated through, 45-90 seconds.
