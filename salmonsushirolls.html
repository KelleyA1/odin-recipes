 <strong><p>How To Prepare</p></strong>

 <ol>
   <li><strong><p>Cook The Sushi Rice</p></strong>
        <p>Place the rice in a sieve over a saucepan and rinse with cold water to remove the starch. Replace with fresh water 3-4 times until the water turns clear. After cleaning the rice, 350ml of cold water and the rice into a pan and leave to soak for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>Place over a hob, and bring the water to a boil on a high heat with the lid on. As soon as it is bubbling, reduce to the lowest setting for 12 minutes, keeping the lid on.</p>
        <p>Don't lift the lid at all during the cooking process. After 12 minutes, take off the heat and rest for 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>Transfer to a large mixing bowl and sprinkle 70ml of sushi vinegar onto the rice, mixing it well, so that all the rice grains are coated.</p>
        <p>After mixing the vinegar, leave to cool for a further 30 minutes, after which the rice is ready to make sushi.</p>
   </li>

  <li><strong><p>Preparation</p></strong>
      <p>Cut the avocado in half, remove the stone, peel off the skin and cut into 6 strips.</p>
      <p>Place the seaweed shiny side down on the sushi mat with the wooden lines horizontal. You can cover the mat with cling film to make it easier - ensure it is tightly covered and air tight.</p>
      <p>Divide  the rice into 4 equal portions.</p>
  </li>

  <li><strong><p>Tuna & Avocado Sushi Roll (8 pieces)</p></strong>

      <p>Put on your gloves or wet your hands, place one portion of rice onto the seaweed at the bottom, gently push the rice all the way to the edges and about 2/3 of the way up the seaweed.</p>
      <p>Sprinkle a quarter of the sesame over the rice with a teaspoon.</p>
      <p>To flip it upside down, pick up the seaweed from the top two corners and then pull towards, turning it upside down.</p>
      <p>Fold over the seaweed flap from the bottom without rice on it.</p>
      <p>Place half the tuna on the seaweed 1/3 from the bottom of the sheet, and ensure the tuna goes right to the edge of the seaweed.</p>
      <p>Spread sriracha sauce over the tuna.</p>
      <p>Sprinkle half the shallots over the sauce with a teaspoon.</p>
      <p>Place half of the avocado strips next to the tuna.</p>
      <p>Using the mat, roll the sushi away from you into a square, gently but firmly, pulling the sushi mat up and back as you go so as not to roll it inside the sushi.</p>
      <p>Using a sharp knife, cut the sushi roll into half, then each half into 4 pieces, making 8 pieces in total.</p>
