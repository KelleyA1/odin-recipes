  <h2 style="color: #642f2f; font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: 300; text-align: center;">The Answer to Life`s Everyday Question (in 50 F*@#ing Recipes)</h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h2>
<br>
<br>

  <p>Everyone needs to aet. I once heard of a man who baffled scientist with his reputed ability to forego eating for years on end, and well, that man is dead. And I can`t imagine  a less fun party guest. Some people say it`s a drag to have to feed yourself, but plain and simple, those people are douchbags. But you, lover of all things gastronomic, you are a special breed. You possess the innate knowledge that feeding yourself, in addition to be a necessary activity, can be hell of a lot of fun. But there is a dark side to being wholly knowledgeable and handsome: choice. Choice, yes fucking choice; it`s the cold bitch that stands between you and food coma. When I created the What the Fuck Should I Make for Dinner website (www.whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com), it was not out of benevolence. No sir or madam: it was out of malice for choce (did I mention choice is a bitch?) who; on many occasions has left me crying, shaking uncomfortably in the corner of my appartment, hungry and confused. And so, with this book, like the website, I hope that I can silence the voices in your head, even if only for a night, and tell your indecisive ass what the fuck to make for dinner.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Lessen vegetables`meat envy with some fucking</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Kale with Bacon</h3>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>6 bacon slices, coarsely chopped</li>
  <li>2 shallots, finely chopped</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
  <li>2 bunches kale, torn into i-inch pieces</li>
  <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons mustard seed</li>
</ul>
  <p>Cook the bacon perfectly in a saute pan over medium heat. Do not fuck this up, or you will ruin the best part of the dish. Remember, without bacon this is just kale, and "just kale" can suck. When it`s perfect, tranfer the bacon to some paper towels, and let it hang out while the adults are talking. Don`t you dare even think about draining the fat from the pan.
  </p>
  <p>Add the shallots and garlic to the pan and saute until tender, about 2 minutes. Add the kale, stock and mustard seed, cook that shit for about 10 minutes, then lie to your kids about vegetables being not awful without the addition of meat.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Honor the mighty pig god with some fucking</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Prosciutto and Melon with Balsamic Glaze</h3>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
  <li>1/4 cup dark brown sugar</li>
  <p>packed</p>
  <li>1 cantaloupe</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons fresh mint</li>
  <li>6 onces prosciutto</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

  <p>Fucking <em>buongiorno,</em> epic pork and fruit dish. In a saucepan over high heat, bring the vinegar and sugar to a boil, then simmer until it`s syrupy as fuck. Cut big cubes from the cantaloupe and chiffonade the mint.</p>
  <p>Arrange the cantaloupe on a plate, place a halo of precious pig meat product on there, and srpinkle the mint on top. Season that shit with salt and pepper, then spoon on the balsamic glaze.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">It`s not cute when your kids say "pasghetti," so teach them to say, make, and eat some fucking</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Bucatini with Tomato, Mozzarella, and Basil</h3>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 pound plum tomatoes</li>
    <li>8 onces fresh mozzarella cheese</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 cup fresh basil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgen olive oil</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>12 onces bucatini</li>
</ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Dice the tomatoes and mozzarella and throw that shit in a bowl. MInce the garlic and tear the basil, and add them to the mix with the olive oil and salt and pepper to taste. Don`t pussy-foot around the salt and pepper, unless of course you have an affinity for shitty food; then please, pussyfoot away.</p>
  <p>Let the mixture sit for an hour. Cook the pasta in heavily salted water until al dente: that`s Italian for "not total shit." Then, add the tomatoe mixture, toss, and serve.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">I`d say eat shit, but that wouldn`t be helpful, so why don`t you make some fucking</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Braised Lamb Shanks</h3>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>Divided 6 lamb shanks</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    <li>Diced 3 ribs celery</li>
    <li>Diced 2 carrots, 1 large white onion, 5 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
    <li>1 whole head of garlic, cut in half crosswise</li>
    <li>3 cups red wine</li>
    <li>2 cups beef stock</li>
    <li>2 cups chiken stock</li>
</ul>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>Preheat your oven to 325-F. Put a Dutch oven over high heat and add 3 tablespoons of oil. Season the lamb shanks with shitload of salt and pepper, and add to the pan. Sear the shit out of lamb shanks until they are browned all over and the fucking neighbors can smell them, but don`t give them any. Remove the shanks for a few minutes. Add 3 more tablespoons of oil in the pot and add the diced celery, carrot, and onion. Cook them until they`re fucking soft and sweet, about 10 minutes. Add the thyme and garlic, and cook for 2 more minutes. Add the wine and both stocks, raise the heat to high, and bring that shit to a boil. Put the lamb shanks back in the pot, seal that shit with some aluminium foil or a lid, and put it inthe oven. You didn`t forget to preheat the oven did you? Goddamn right you didn`t. Cook thet shit for 3 to 4 hours, uncovering after an hour. Skim the fat, serve, and be hailed as a god ar at the very least a demigod.</p>

  <p>AND Just in case, IF any of my personal suggestions works for you, than F*@# off from this site and visit <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nsfw-recipe-generator-wha_n_559223" target="_blank">Visit - NSFW Recipe Generator</a></p>
  <p>(WTFSIMFD, for our purposes) is a new recipe generator that happens to be pretty NSFW because of its prominent huge-lettered use of the word, "FU*KING."</p>
  <p>Pulling its suggested recipes from the <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/" title="Epicurious" target="_blank">Epicurious</a> recipe database, WTFSIMFD is basically Recipe Roulette, and admirably simple:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A non-vegetarian dish is suggested ("TRY SOME FU*KING" whatever). Click on the suggested dish for the recipe at Epicurious.</li>
    <li>Don't like that dish? Click "I DON'T FU*KING LIKE THAT" for another.</li>
    <li>Want something non-vegetarian? Click "I DON'T FU*KING EAT MEAT," which takes you to WTFSIMFD, the vegetarian edition.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><a href="http://www.whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com/" target="_blank">What the Fu*k Should I Make for Dinner:</a> it's what's fu*king for dinner.</p>
